# PyTorch-Exercise


**2. week Optimizer** : In this document, the second week of Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch course; Mini Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Batch Gradient Descent were compared.

**Regression-Ä°dmanlar**: Regression is estimated for different datasets in this document

**pytorch-idman-1** : A simple synthetic classifier dataset has been created in this reader. Loss values were shown in the training.

**word_embeddings_tutorial(1)** : I reviewed WORD EMBEDDINGS: ENCODING LEXICAL SEMANTICS. The codes at https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/word_embeddings_tutorial.html were studied. I have examined it step by step with the StepLogger function.
