# PyTorch-Exercise


**2. week Optimizer** : In this document, the second week of Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch course; Mini Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Batch Gradient Descent were compared.

**Regression-Ä°dmanlar**: Regression is estimated for different datasets in this document

**pytorch-idman-1** : A simple synthetic classifier dataset has been created in this reader. Loss values were shown in the training.
